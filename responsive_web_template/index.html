                </h3>
                Social platforms influence how we interact with politics. Stories, viewpoints and figures are promoted algorithmically based not on their relevance, veracity or importance; but by the amount of time a user spends looking, this is the Attention Economy. how much attention a post or tweet gets can be broken down in a variety of ways: something can be novel, funny or informative; noticeably however it can also be depressing, terrifying or even infuriating. Now when all of these are equally incentivised by the ad-based model what are the results of such a model.

                <h3>
                    The Political Problem
                </h3>
                These issues arise due to how we've chosen to structure our social platforms. Algorithmically building our news feed by what alligns to our views and filtering out those that don't, This is known as the Filter Bubble. Moreover when opposing views are introduced, the algorithm is incentivised to introduce such elements in the most inflammatory way possible, here outrage becomes synonymous with attention.

                <blockquote cite="http://humanetech.com/problem/">
                "Social media rewards outrage, false facts, and filter bubbles – which are better at capturing attention – and divides us so we can no longer agree on truth." - Tristan Harris
                </blockquote>

                This is problematic not only because the incentive is to keep the user on site, within the loop of outrage and not acting on their political or moral motivations outside of the digital landscape. It also has the potential to drive user further towards their current political predilections and reinforce an echo-chamber style of political engagement. This in turn can lead to false information, that confirms their narrative, being preferred and thus algorithmically promoted. This can exacerbates the phenomena of "fake news" and propaganda.

                </h4>

                An avenue out of the outrage cycle. People are more politically enganged than ever and this is in part due to social media platforms. However it's important as a society to take this political energy into the real world and enact change, as opposed to it being monetized for ad revenue. Thus the Cash-out app would profile the user's political views and show them real world organisations that align with those values. For example a user who repeatedly shares or retweets pro-veganism, animal rights or posts
